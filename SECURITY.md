# Security Policy

Only the most recent version will get non-security fix updates. This is to ensure optimal efficency, as older versions may implement features in unoptimal ways, which are hard to work with.

## Supported Versions

All beta or alpha versions aren't supported, otherwise you can expect support for the last two major versions in most cases.

| Version    | Supported          |
| ---------  | ------------------ |
| 1.5.x      | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.4.x      | :white_check_mark: |
| <= 0.1.4.2 | :x:                |
