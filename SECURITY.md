# Security Policy

Only the most recent version will get non-security updates. This is to ensure optimal efficency, as older versions may implement features in unoptimal ways, which are hard to work with.

## Supported Versions

All beta or alpha versions aren't supported, otherwise you can expect support for the last two major versions in most cases.

Legend:
- ✓ -> Fully supported
- ~ -> Mostly supported / depends
- ✗ -> No longer supported
