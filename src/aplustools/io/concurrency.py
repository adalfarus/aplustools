class ThreadSafeList(list):
    """
    A thread-safe implementation of a Python list, ensuring that all mutation operations are protected by a lock.

    This class extends the built-in Python `list` and overrides key methods to ensure that operations like
    appending, removing, setting items, and modifying the list are thread-safe. It uses a lock (`_Lock`)
    to synchronize access, making it safe for use in multithreaded environments.

    This class is useful when you need a list that can be shared between threads and you want to prevent
    race conditions when modifying the list. Read operations such as `__getitem__` and `__len__` are also
    protected for full thread safety, though read-only operations are generally safe unless done concurrently
    with writes.

    Attributes:
        _lock (_Lock): A threading lock used to synchronize access to the list and prevent race conditions.

    Example:
        ts_list = ThreadSafeList([1, 2, 3])
        ts_list.append(4)
        ts_list.remove(2)

        # Safe iteration over a copy
        for item in ts_list:
            print(item)

    Methods:
        append(item): Thread-safe method for appending an item to the list.
        remove(item): Thread-safe method for removing the first occurrence of an item.
        insert(index, item): Thread-safe method for inserting an item at a specific index.
        pop(index=-1): Thread-safe method for removing and returning an item at the given index (default last).
        __setitem__(index, value): Thread-safe method for setting the value at a specific index.
        __delitem__(index): Thread-safe method for deleting the item at a specific index.
        extend(iterable): Thread-safe method for extending the list with an iterable.
        sort(*args, **kwargs): Thread-safe method for sorting the list in place.
        reverse(): Thread-safe method for reversing the list in place.
        __getitem__(index): Thread-safe method for retrieving the item at the given index.
        __len__(): Thread-safe method for retrieving the length of the list.
        __iter__(): Thread-safe method for iterating over the list by returning a copy to avoid modification during iteration.

    Notes:
        - For full thread safety, both read and write operations are protected by a lock.
        - When iterating over the list, the `__iter__()` method returns a copy of the list to avoid issues
          when the list is modified during iteration by another thread.
        - If additional list methods are required, they should be overridden and wrapped with the lock to
          ensure thread safety.

    """
    A highly dynamic thread pool executor that rapidly scales the number of worker threads based on workload demand.

    This executor adjusts the number of threads between a minimum and maximum range, with a focus on rapid scaling
    up and down. Idle threads are aggressively cleaned up at regular intervals to ensure optimal resource management.
    The pool dynamically and quickly scales the number of active threads according to the task load.

    Attributes:
        _min_workers (int): The minimum number of worker threads that should always remain active.
        _max_workers (int | None): The maximum number of worker threads allowed in the pool. If None, the number of
                                  workers can grow indefinitely based on the workload.
        _check_interval (float): The interval (in seconds) between checks for idle threads to join or remove. Lower values
                                lead to more frequent checks and faster thread scaling.
        _thread_name_prefix (str): Optional prefix to name the worker threads, useful for identifying threads in logs or
                                  debugging.
        _initializer (Callable): A callable that initializes each worker thread when it is created, useful for setting up
                                thread-specific state (e.g., opening a database connection).
        _initargs (tuple): A tuple of arguments to pass to the `initializer` callable for initializing worker threads.

    Example:
        executor = HyperDynamicThreadPoolExecutor(min_workers=2, max_workers=100, check_interval=0.1)
        executor.submit(task_function)

    Methods:
        _join_threads(): Private method that checks the pool for idle threads and aggressively joins (terminates) them
                         to release resources.
        shutdown(wait=True, cancel_futures=False): Gracefully shuts down the thread pool by joining all threads and
                                                   optionally canceling pending futures.

    Notes:
        - This class is designed for environments where the workload fluctuates rapidly, and thread management needs to
          respond quickly to avoid over or under-utilization of resources.
        - It uses a timer to aggressively check and join idle threads at the defined `check_interval`, allowing for
          faster scaling compared to other thread pool implementations.
        - The `_lock` attribute ensures that thread pool modifications (such as joining threads or resizing the pool) are
          thread-safe.

class LazySelfManagingDynamicThreadPoolExecutor(LazyDynamicThreadPoolExecutor):
    """
    A self-managing dynamic thread pool executor that lazily scales worker threads based on workload demands.

    This thread pool dynamically adjusts the number of active worker threads between a specified minimum and maximum.
    Each worker thread autonomously monitors its own workload and decides whether to terminate if no tasks are available,
    leading to efficient resource management. The pool lazily scales up or down as tasks are added or completed.

    Attributes:
        _min_workers (int): The minimum number of worker threads that should always remain active.
        _max_workers (int | None): The maximum number of worker threads allowed in the pool. If None, the number of
                                   workers can grow indefinitely based on the workload.
        _check_interval (float): The interval (in seconds) between idle thread checks.
        _max_join_number (int): The maximum number of idle threads that can be joined in one pass during the idle check.
        _thread_name_prefix (str): Optional prefix to name the worker threads for easier identification in logs.
        _initializer (Callable): A callable to initialize each worker thread when it is created, useful for setting up
                                 thread-specific resources (e.g., opening database connections).
        _initargs (tuple): A tuple of arguments to pass to the `initializer` callable.

    Example:
        executor = LazySelfManagingDynamicThreadPoolExecutor(min_workers=2, max_workers=10, check_interval=1.0)
        executor.submit(task_function)

    Methods:
        _lazy_self_reporting_worker(): Private worker method where each thread monitors its workload, reports idle state,
                                       and determines whether to shut down when there are no tasks.
        _join_threads(): Private method that checks for idle threads and joins them to release resources.
        shutdown(wait=True, cancel_futures=False): Gracefully shuts down the thread pool by joining all threads
                                                   and optionally canceling pending futures.

    Notes:
        - Each worker thread autonomously reports its state and handles its lifecycle (lazy termination) when idle,
          contributing to efficient resource usage.
        - The class periodically checks for idle threads and manages resources by dynamically resizing the pool as needed.
        - Thread pool modifications (e.g., joining threads or resizing) are thread-safe due to the use of a `_lock` attribute.
